Understanding Zero-Knowledge Proofs","text":"<p>The most significant role of blockchain as a distributed system is verification. We mentioned earlier that zkWasm achieves deterministic and verifiable state transitions, so why do we need verification? What is determinism and verifiability in the context of blockchain, and what role does zero-knowledge proof play in it?</p> <p>Let's start with the essential properties of blockchain. Blockchain is a decentralized network where each node is equal, and there is no centralized authority. This brings the following problems:</p> <ul> <li>How to reach consensus among untrusted nodes? </li> <li>How to ensure that the state transitions seen by each node are consistent and correct?</li> </ul> <p>This requires the introduction of a verification mechanism. When accepting a new state transition (such as a transaction or a new block), each node needs to verify its legitimacy. Only state transitions that pass verification can be added to the blockchain and become part of the global consensus.</p> <p>To achieve reliable verification, determinism and verifiability are needed:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Determinism means that given the same input, the same output is always obtained. In blockchain, determinism means that each node, executing the same state transition logic, will get the same result. This is the premise of reaching consensus. Imagine if the result of a state transition is non-deterministic (for example, dependent on the execution environment or random numbers), different nodes might get different states, breaking the consensus.</p> </li> <li> <p>Verifiability means that the correctness of a state transition can be efficiently verified. In blockchain, verifiability means that any node can quickly check whether a state transition is legal without redoing all the computations. Imagine if verifying a state transition requires replaying the entire computation process, the cost of verification would be as high as generating the state transition, which is unacceptable in computationally intensive situations.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Traditional blockchains (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) achieve determinism by replaying every transaction on each node, and achieve verifiability through a hash-linked block structure. But this method is less efficient, especially when the state transition logic is complex.</p> <p>This is where zero-knowledge proofs come into play. Zero-knowledge proofs are a cryptographic technique that can prove a statement is correct without revealing any information. In blockchain, zero-knowledge proofs can be used to prove that a state transition is legal without revealing the specific input data and intermediate states. More Information about Zero-Knowledge Proofs can be found here or Later in Supplemental Resources.</p> <p>Zero-knowledge proofs provide a more efficient way to implement determinism and verifiability:</p> <ul> <li> <p>For determinism, zero-knowledge proofs require the state transition logic to be deterministic (like zkWasm using a deterministic Wasm subset) to generate proofs.</p> </li> <li> <p>For verifiability, zero-knowledge proofs allow the prover to generate a succinct proof proving the correctness of the state transition, and the verifier only needs to check this proof without redoing the computation. This greatly reduces the cost of verification.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Here's an example. Suppose there is a complex state transition that requires 1,000,000 steps of computation. In a traditional blockchain, each node would need to replay these 1,000,000 steps to verify the result. But with zero-knowledge proofs, the prover only needs to do the computation once to generate a proof, and the verifier might only need to do 100 steps of computation to verify this proof.</p> <p>In addition to efficiency, zero-knowledge proofs bring another important property: privacy. Since the proving process does not reveal input data and intermediate states, zero-knowledge proofs allow verifying the correctness of a computation result without disclosing the original data. This is very important for privacy-sensitive application scenarios (like finance and healthcare).</p>"},{"location":"Core%20Concepts.html#supplemental-resources","title":"Supplemental Resources","text":"<ul> <li>Zero-Knowledge Mastery: A comprehensive guide to zero-knowledge proofs.</li> <li>zkhack: zkhack is a hub for zk learning and building.

Introduction to zkWasm","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>This section provides a high-level overview of zkWasm. For more detailed information about zkWasm, please refer to the:</p> <ul> <li>zkWasm Whitepaper</li> <li>zkWasm Book</li> </ul> <p>zkWasm represents a fundamental advancement in the field of trustless computation by combining WebAssembly with zero-knowledge proofs. The system implements a complete WebAssembly virtual machine within zkSNARK circuits, creating a bridge between traditional application development and blockchain technology. This approach allows developers to write programs in familiar languages while gaining the benefits of zero-knowledge proofs without requiring specialized cryptographic knowledge.</p> <p>The core innovation of zkWasm lies in its approach to implementing zero-knowledge proofs. Rather than requiring developers to write programs in specialized circuit-friendly languages, zkWasm applies zero-knowledge proofs at the bytecode level of the virtual machine. This means that any program that can be compiled to WebAssembly can automatically benefit from zero-knowledge capabilities, making the technology accessible to a much broader range of developers and applications. </p> <p>Traditional approaches to implementing zero-knowledge proofs often require developers to work with specialized languages and tools like Pinocchio, TinyRAM, or ZoKrates. This requirement creates a significant barrier to adoption, as developers must learn new programming paradigms and rewrite existing applications. zkWasm eliminates this barrier by operating at the WebAssembly level, allowing developers to work in languages they already know, such as C++, Rust, or AssemblyScript.</p> <p></p> <p>This accessibility extends beyond just the programming language choice. While traditional blockchain development requires extensive knowledge of specific blockchain protocols and smart contract languages, zkWasm further simplifies the blockchain integration process. By operating at the WebAssembly bytecode level, zkWasm automatically handles the generation of zero-knowledge proofs for any application logic like user operations and user interactions. These standardized proofs can be verified on any blockchain platform without requiring developers to write custom smart contracts or complex blockchain-specific protocols for application logic. This approach not only lowers the technical barriers for Web2 developers (as well as their users) entering the Web3 space, but also enables seamless cross-chain compatibility for their applications. </p> <p>Info</p> <p>Compared to the traditional Web3 applications which heavily rely on smart contracts and a specific blockchain system, zkWasm applications are more like Web2 applications, but with the trustless verification capabilities brought by zero-knowledge proofs, it can:</p> <ul> <li>Seamlessly integrate with existing Web2 or Web3 applications</li> <li>Allow developers to focus on business logic and frontend design, without the need to learn much about blockchain or zero-knowledge proofs</li> <li>Allow developers to easily switch between different blockchain platforms if needed</li> <li>Allow developers to easily scale or upgrade their applications</li> <li>Allow gasless interactions and operations (except for the proof verification, deposit and withdrawal which is required when manipulating the onchain assets) for application users</li> </ul>"},{"location":"zkWasm%20Overview.html#2-the-state-machine-foundation","title":"2. The State Machine Foundation","text":"<p>At its core, zkWasm operates as a state machine that processes WebAssembly bytecode while generating proofs of correct execution. The state machine takes as input a tuple consisting of several key components that together define the program and its execution environment. This tuple, represented as (I(C,H), E, IO), contains the WebAssembly executable image I (which includes both code C and initial memory state H), the entry point E, and the input/output firmware IO.</p> <p>The state machine maintains an internal state that captures every aspect of program execution. This state, represented as a tuple (iaddr, F, M, G, Sp, I, IO), includes the current instruction address (iaddr), the call frame (F), memory state (M), global variables (G), and the execution stack (Sp). Each of these components plays a crucial role in program execution and proof generation.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Understanding the state machine model is crucial for application development because:</p> <ul> <li>Design the state machine model before starting to write code will help a lot on development efficiency</li> <li>Your application's performance depends on minimizing state transitions</li> <li>Proper state handling is essential for correctness and security of your application</li> <li>Consider using tools to analyze your application's state transitions during development</li> </ul>"},{"location":"zkWasm%20Overview.html#state-representation-and-execution-flow","title":"State Representation and Execution Flow","text":"<p>The instruction address (iaddr) keeps track of the current position in the program, determining which instruction will be executed next.

This memory can be read from and written to during program execution, with all operations being tracked and verified through the proof system. Global variables (G) provide a way to maintain state across function calls, while the stack (Sp) handles temporary values and computation results.</p> <p>Program execution proceeds through a series of state transitions, with each transition function taking the current state and producing a new state based on the instruction being executed.

Host (Builtin) Functions","text":"<p>Besides the WebAssembly instructions, zkWasm also provides a set of host functions that are not defined in the WebAssembly module itself but are provided by the environment in which the WebAssembly code is executed. These functions are crucial for WebAssembly modules to interact with the outside world, as WASM on its own is quite sandboxed and limited in what it can do directly.</p> <p>Here are some key points about WASM host functions:</p> <ul> <li>Interaction with the Environment: WASM is designed to be a low-level, portable bytecode, which runs in a sandboxed environment. By itself, it doesn't have direct access to the system's resources like file systems, network, or the DOM in web browsers. Host functions serve as the bridge between the WASM code and these external resources.</li> <li>Provided by the Host Environment: The host environment (which could be a web browser, a server-side platform like Node.js, or any other system that supports running WebAssembly) defines and provides these host functions. For instance, in a web browser, the host functions might allow interactions with web APIs.</li> <li>Imported into WASM Modules: WASM modules import these host functions and use them as if they were part of the module. This import/export mechanism is part of the WASM design, allowing for modular code and separation of concerns.</li> <li>Custom Functionality: Host functions can be used to provide custom functionality to WASM modules that is not available in the standard WASM instruction set. This can include anything from accessing the file system to performing complex computations that are more efficiently done in the host language (like JavaScript in the case of web browsers).</li> </ul> <p>In the zkWasm system, a wide range of pre-defined host functions are provided to make it easier to build complex applications. These host functions are divided into three main categories:</p> <ul> <li>I/O related host functions: These functions handle the input and output operations in zkWasm. They provide ways for reading both public and private inputs, keeping track of the current position in the input stream, and outputting results. The difference between public and private inputs is very important for zero-knowledge applications.</li> <li>Merkle tree related host functions: zkWasm includes a Merkle tree implementation for efficiently verifying large data structures. The Merkle tree host functions include setting the root, specifying leaf addresses, updating and retrieving values, and getting the root hash. These functions follow a specific set of rules to ensure consistency and verifiability.</li> <li>Cryptographic operation related host functions: zkWasm implements advanced cryptographic operations, particularly the Poseidon signature scheme, which works well with zero-knowledge proofs. The signature host functions use elliptic curve cryptography (through the BabyJubjub curve) and involve multi-scalar multiplication for verification. These functions provide a secure and efficient way to perform cryptographic operations within the zkWasm environment.</li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>When developing zkWasm applications:</p> <ul> <li>Use host functions for external interactions and cryptographic operations (like user operations and signature)</li> <li>Carefully manage the distinction between public and private inputs</li> <li>Leverage the Merkle tree functions for efficient data structure storage, retrieval, and verification, because in zkWasm, we implement Merkle tree as Database Service.</li> <li>Design your application architecture around these built-in capabilities rather than implementing custom solutions.    </li> </ul>"},{"location":"zkWasm%20Overview.html#inputoutput-system-implementation","title":"Input/Output System Implementation","text":"<p>The input/output system in zkWasm provides a mechanism for handling both public and private data.

This segmentation allows for efficient proof generation while maintaining the security and correctness of the overall system.</p> <p>zkWasm generates three types of proofs that work together to verify program execution:</p> <ol> <li>Guest Circuit Proofs: Verify the correct execution of WebAssembly instructions within a segment. These proofs ensure that each instruction follows the WebAssembly specification.</li> <li>Host Circuit Proofs: Validate external function calls and their results. These proofs verify that interactions with the environment (through host functions) are correct.</li> <li>Aggregation Circuit Proofs: Combine multiple proofs into a single, verifiable proof. This includes connecting segment proofs and ensuring the overall execution is valid.</li> </ol> <p>The proof generation process begins with individual segment proofs, creates continuation proofs to connect the segments, and finally combines everything into a single, verifiable proof. This hierarchical approach allows zkWasm to handle complex applications while maintaining efficient proof generation and verification.</p>"},{"location":"zkWasm%20Overview.html#5-development-process-and-best-practices","title":"5. Development Process and Best Practices","text":"<p>Developing applications for zkWasm requires careful attention to state management and performance optimization. State changes should be minimized when possible, as each state transition must be proved in the zero-knowledge system. Related operations should be batched together when possible to reduce the number of state transitions and improve proof generation efficiency.</p> <p>Besides, memory management plays a crucial role in zkWasm application performance. The linear memory model of WebAssembly must be used efficiently, with careful attention paid to memory layout and access patterns. Global variables should be used judiciously, as they affect the state that must be tracked and proved.</p> <p>Error handling in zkWasm applications requires special consideration due to the zero-knowledge context. Errors must be handled in a way that doesn't leak information about private data while still providing useful feedback about what went wrong. This often involves careful design of error conditions and appropriate use of public and private inputs.

How do we distinguish which transactions need to be settled on-chain?</p> <p>A: The off-chain processing is actually the same for both types. You can think of the transactions that modify on-chain state as having \"side effects\". The rollup processes them identically, but some transactions will trigger additional on-chain state changes.</p>"},{"location":"additional-resources/Frequently%20Asked%20Questions.html#zkwasm-application-migration-and-upgrades","title":"zkWasm Application Migration and Upgrades","text":"<p>Q: Why don't we need to modify the Verifier contract when upgrading a zkWasm application?</p> <p>A: This is because zkWasm uses image as input to the circuit, and there's an image commitment that checks which image the proof is for. When you upgrade the logic, you don't need to change the circuit because the entire zkWasm virtual machine is written in circuits. This makes the verifier universal and applicable across different versions of your application logic.</p> <p>The image is part of the input, and the commitment mechanism ensures verification of which specific image (application version) the proof corresponds to. This design allows for logic upgrades without requiring changes to the underlying verification infrastructure.</p> <p>Q: In MIGRATE, why do we only get the Merkle root from the contract? How is this sufficient for an upgrade?</p> <p>A: The upgrade mechanism only allows changes to the business logic, not the data structure. Since the data structure remains unchanged, updating the Merkle root is sufficient. The mini-rollup doesn't need to be modified because the underlying data structure remains the same.</p>"},{"location":"additional-resources/Official%20Links.html","title":"Official Links","text":"<p>Welcome to DelphinusLab's official communication channels and resources.

And specifically, in <code>generateRandomSeed()</code>:     <pre><code>function randByte() {\n    return Math.floor(Math.random() * 0xff); // generate a random byte between 0 and 255, this is because the randseed is a 64-bit array of bytes\n}\nasync function generateRandomSeed() {\n    let randSeed = [randByte(), randByte(), randByte(), randByte(), randByte(), randByte(), randByte(), randByte()]; // generate a 64-bit randseed\n    let sha = sha256(new Uint8Array(randSeed)); // hash the randseed\n    const mask64 = BigInt(\"0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\"); // generate a 64-bit mask\n    const shaCommitment = BigInt(sha) &amp; mask64; // mask the sha to 64-bit\n    const randRecord = new modelRand({\n        commitment: shaCommitment.toString(),\n        seed: randSeed,\n    });  // create a new rand record\n    await randRecord.save(); // save the rand record to the database\n    return shaCommitment; // return the commitment\n}\n</code></pre>     The commitment and rand seed are stored in the database and the commitment is returned to the server.</li> <li>Then, <code>application.randSeed()</code> returns 0 (which is the initial value) and assign it to <code>oldSeed</code>.

This index is used to retrieve the actual token contract address through the <code>get_token_uid</code> function.</li> <li>The <code>pid_1</code> and <code>pid_2</code> parameters (both uint64) together form a unique player identifier within the zkWasm system. This two-part identifier corresponds to the <code>player_id: [u64; 2]</code> structure used in the <code>Player</code> struct in the zkWasm mini rollup ABI. Therefore, we can use the <code>pid_1</code> and <code>pid_2</code> to identify which player is depositing the token.</li> <li>The <code>amount</code> parameter (uint128) specifies the deposit amount in wei, representing the smallest unit of the token being deposited, this means the amount has to be multiplied by 10^18 to represent the actual amount of the token.</li> </ul> <p>When a user calls the <code>topup</code> function, the following steps will be performed:</p> <ol> <li>The <code>topup</code> function will first check if the token is a local token (which means the token is supported by the blockchain) by calling the <code>_is_local</code> function.

What will happen next? </p> <p>Actually... nothing will happen next. The <code>TopUp</code> event is just a notification event, it does not trigger any further actions. So how does the zkWasm Rollup Application know that the user has deposited the token? We need to implement a mechanism to listen to the <code>TopUp</code> event and trigger the corresponding actions to process the deposit in the zkWasm Rollup Application. A good way to do this is to use a deposit monitor which operates by the server's admin.</p>"},{"location":"zkwasm-protocol/Deposit.html#deposit-monitor","title":"Deposit Monitor","text":"<p>In this section, we will implement a typescript node.js service that can listen to the <code>TopUp</code> event and trigger the corresponding actions to process the deposit in the zkWasm Rollup Application. The original code is in the <code>deposit.ts</code> file in a game called automata.</p> <p>Let's start by implementing the service that can: 1. retrieve all past <code>TopUp</code> events from the proxy contract and process each event.  2. listen to new <code>TopUp</code> events from the proxy contract and process each event.</p> <p>The service can be concluded as the following code: <pre><code>async function main() {\n    const dbName = `${process.env.SETTLEMENT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS}_deposit`; // Dynamically set DB name using contract address\n    // Connect to MongoDB (without deprecated options)\n    await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {\n        dbName,\n    }).then(() =&gt; console.log('MongoDB connected'));\n    // Get all TopUp events from the contract\n    await getTopUpEvents();\n    // Listen for new TopUp events\n    proxyContract.on('TopUp', async (l1token, address, pid_1, pid_2, amount, event) =&gt; {\n        console.log(event);\n        //const eventLog = event as EventLog;  // Explicitly cast to EventLog\n        //console.log(eventLog);\n        console.log(`New TopUp event detected: ${event.log.transactionHash}`);\n        // Process the new TopUp event\n        await processTopUpEvent(event.log);\n    });\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>In order to make sure the events will not be processed multiple times, we need to store the events transaction information in the database. Here we use MongoDB to do this.</p> <p><pre><code>const txSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n    txHash: { type: String, required: true, unique: true }, // Ensure txHash is unique\n    state: { type: String, enum: ['pending', 'in-progress', 'completed', 'failed'], default: 'pending' },\n    timestamp: { type: Date, default: Date.now },\n    l1token: { type: String, required: true },\n    address: { type: String, required: true },\n    pid_1: { type: BigInt, required: true },\n    pid_2: { type: BigInt, required: true },\n    amount: { type: BigInt, required: true },\n});\nconst TxHash = mongoose.model('TxHash', txSchema);\n</code></pre> The above code defines a schema for the <code>TxHash</code> collection in the database. Each <code>TxHash</code> document will have fields that correspond to the parameters of the <code>TopUp</code> event. Notably, the state field is used to indicate the status of the event processing which can be used to prevent the event from being processed multiple times.</p> <p>When we start the service, after connecting to the database, we will first retrieve all past <code>TopUp</code> events from the proxy contract and process each event. This is specifically useful for the server's admin to check if there are any deposits that need to be processed when initializing the monitor:</p> <pre><code>// Function to retrieve all past TopUp events\nasync function getTopUpEvents() {\n    try {\n        // You can specify a block range, or use `fromBlock: 0` to query all events\n        const filter = proxyContract.filters.TopUp();\n        const events = await proxyContract.queryFilter(filter, 0, 'latest');\n        console.log(`Found ${events.length} TopUp events.`);\n        for (const event of events) {\n            const eventLog = event;\n            // Process each past event\n            await processTopUpEvent(eventLog);\n        }\n    }\n    catch (error) {\n        console.error('Error retrieving TopUp events:', error);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Then the service will listen to new <code>TopUp</code> events from the proxy contract and process each event: <pre><code>proxyContract.on('TopUp', async (l1token, address, pid_1, pid_2, amount, event) =&gt; {\n    console.log(event);\n    //const eventLog = event as EventLog;  // Explicitly cast to EventLog\n    //console.log(eventLog);\n    console.log(`New TopUp event detected: ${event.log.transactionHash}`);\n    // Process the new TopUp event\n    await processTopUpEvent(event.log);\n});\n</code></pre></p> <p>Once there is a new <code>TopUp</code> event, the service will process the event by calling the <code>processTopUpEvent</code> function. </p> <p>Let's take a look at the <code>processTopUpEvent</code> function:</p> <pre><code>async function processTopUpEvent(event) {\n    const eventLog = event;\n    const [l1token, address, pid_1, pid_2, amount] = eventLog.args;\n    if (l1token !== (await proxyContract._tokens(0))) {\n        console.log('Skip not the right token: ', l1token);\n        return;\n    }\n    console.log(`TopUp event received: pid_1=${pid_1.toString()}, pid_2=${pid_2.toString()}, amount=${amount.toString()} wei`);\n    // Check if this transaction is already in the database and in 'pending' or 'in-progress' state\n    let tx = await findTxByHash(event.transactionHash);\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>First, the function will check if the token is the right token (the token that can be deposited into the zkWasm Rollup Application) by comparing the <code>l1token</code> (which is the uid of the token) with the token uid stored in the proxy contract. If the token is not the right token, the function will skip the event. </p> <p>Tip</p> <p>You can implement your own logic to check if the token is the right token by checking the token's uid, for example, if you want to make all the tokens that have been registered in the proxy contract can be deposited into the zkWasm Rollup Application, you can skip the check (because the token has been checked in the <code>topup</code> function in the proxy contract when user deposit the token) or check if the token is supported by the proxy contract by calling the <code>allTokens</code> function and check if the <code>l1token</code> is in the <code>allTokens</code> array.</p> <p>Then the function will check if the transaction is already in the database by calling the <code>findTxByHash</code> function:</p> <pre><code>let tx = await findTxByHash(event.transactionHash);\n</code></pre> <p>If the transaction is not in the database, the function will create a new transaction record which has the initial state as <code>pending</code> in the database:</p> <pre><code>        if (!tx) {\n            console.log(`Transaction hash not found: ${event.transactionHash}`);\n            // Save tx hash and initial state as pending, along with other details\n            tx = new TxHash({\n                txHash: event.transactionHash,\n                state: 'pending', // Initially set to pending\n                l1token,\n                address,\n                pid_1,\n                pid_2,\n                amount,\n            });\n            await tx.save();\n        }\n</code></pre> <p>If the transaction is already in the database or just created through the above code, the function will check if the transaction is in the <code>pending</code> status, if so, it will proceed to process the deposit in the zkWasm Rollup Application:</p> <pre><code>if (tx &amp;&amp; tx.state === 'pending') {\n    try {\n        // Set transaction state to \"in-progress\"\n        await updateTxState(event.transactionHash, 'in-progress');\n        // Convert amount from wei to ether\n        let amountInEther = amount / BigInt(10 ** 18);\n        console.log(\"Deposited amount (in ether): \", amountInEther);\n        if (amountInEther &lt; 1n) {\n            console.error(`--------------Skip: Amount must be at least 1 Titan (in ether instead of wei) ${event.transactionHash}\\n`);\n        }\n        else {\n            // Proceed with the deposit\n            await admin.deposit(pid_1, pid_2, amountInEther);\n            console.log(`------------------Deposit successful! ${event.transactionHash}\\n`);\n        }\n        // After successful deposit, set state to 'completed'\n        await updateTxState(event.transactionHash, 'completed');\n    }\n    catch (error) {\n        console.error('Error during deposit:', error);\n        // In case of failure, mark as 'failed'\n        // await updateTxState(event.transactionHash, 'failed');\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The above code will set the transaction state to <code>in-progress</code>, then convert the amount from wei to ether, and then call the <code>deposit</code> function in the zkWasm Rollup Application to process the deposit. After the deposit is successful, the function will set the transaction state to <code>completed</code>. However, if the deposit fails, the status of the transaction will not be updated to <code>completed</code> and will remain as <code>in-progress</code>.</p> <p>Admin Setup</p> <p>The <code>deposit</code> function is a function in the zkWasm Rollup Application, which is only callable by the admin. You will need to setup the admin key as <code>SERVER_ADMIN_KEY</code> in the <code>.env</code> file first before you can call the <code>deposit</code> function. Also, as a kind of \"player\", you will need to install the admin into the zkWasm Rollup Application by calling the <code>installPlayer</code> function: <pre><code>const rpc = new ZKWasmAppRpc(\"https://rpc.zkplay.app\");\nlet admin = new Player(process.env.SERVER_ADMIN_KEY, rpc);\nconsole.log(\"install admin ...\\n\");\nawait admin.installPlayer();\n</code></pre></p> <p>If the transaction is in the <code>in-progress</code> state, the function will skip the deposit process as this indicates that something went wrong during the deposit process and requires manual intervention.</p> <p>If the transaction is in the <code>completed</code> state, the function will skip the deposit process as this indicates that the deposit has already been processed.</p>"},{"location":"zkwasm-protocol/Deposit.html#deposit-action","title":"Deposit Action","text":"<p>Let's take a look at how admin deposits the token into the zkWasm Rollup Application, in <code>process</code> function in state.rs of the zkWasm Rollup Application (automata):</p> <p><pre><code>DEPOSIT =&gt; {\n    unsafe { require(*pkey == *ADMIN_PUBKEY) };\n    self.deposit(&amp;AutomataPlayer::pkey_to_pid(pkey))\n        .map_or_else(|e| e, |_| 0)\n}\n</code></pre> When it receives a deposit request (<code>admin.deposit(pid_1, pid_2, amountInEther)</code> called in the deposit monitor), it will check if the request is coming from the admin by checking if the public key is the admin's public key (You will get the admin's public key generated from your private key when you build the zkWasm Rollup Application using <code>make build</code>).
